We have included Makefile-driven tests for both our specification and layout.

For the specification directory, you can run Verilog-XL using these targets:
$ make test_controller
$ make test_divider

In our cells & layout directories, we have already included the 'ext' files.
Our cells & layout Makefiles will run both ext2sim and irsim (using assertions).

For the cells directory:
$ make and
$ make or
$ make mux1
$ make shift1
$ make addsub1
$ make reg1

For the layout directory:
$ make controller
$ make datapath
$ make divider
$ make top
(the divider and top targets are two different test cases for the top)
